## Introduction

7 months ago, I stumbled upon a book, that radically changed my view towards Entrepreneurship. Reveiewed and 
testimonies made by Startups and Companies that adopted this principle. It has proved to work and more, the 
reason why If you are an entrepreneur or aspire to being one you should read this book.The book is readily available on [Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/The-Lean-Startup-Entrepreneurs-Continuous/dp/0307887898) and you can read more
about it [here](http://theleanstartup.com).

While reading the book, I got to learn a lot of concepts. There is one word that I have heard all over and I think there is a lot of misconception around the term. Clearly, a sign that most people still haven't read the book and still claim to understand what Lean Startup is. While talking to most entrepreurs or aspiring entrepreneurs about the word "MVP", I found out that most of them did not understand what it was and why we have to use it. 

To clear it out, here is my definition of what MVP means.

## What is MVP ?

*MVP* clearly stands for *Minimum Viable Product* . It is simply a concept adopted from the [Lean Startup Methodology](http://leanstartup.com).

## Some Concepts

Before arriving to the definition, lets get a few concepts from the Lean Startup.

### Hypothesis

When coming up with your startup, most startups seem to be solving an already existing problem. Lets look at the problem from a 
*scientific approach*. Whenever you look at problems in this ways, you will have to deduce a hypothesis that you will test.

### Leap of Faith

Hypothesis are most of the times a set of assumptions, that we test and try to validate. According to Ries, this is one of
the riskiest elements that every Startup encounters. Why is this the case?  This phase solely depends on *leap of faith*
assumptions made by Startup members.

### Build-Measure-Learn

When the *leap of faith* assumptions are made, we enter a new phase. This phase is called the *Build-Measure-Learn* loop process.

As explained in the above diagram, this loop is continuos

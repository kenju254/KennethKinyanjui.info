Summary: My good reads


Good reads is what I called them. I have not been the type that read books, but something stroke me when I first read the  [Outliers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outliers_(book)). I started seeing things in a different perspective and the thrist for more such reads was born. Now reading and coding has been my daily routine. 

I will be updating all the books I am currently reading and have already read that I think you should also read. The links lead to Amazon page and you can get the book easily from there.

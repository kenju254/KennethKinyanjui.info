Summary: Just a simple introduction of who I am 


Hi I'm Kenneth Kinyanjui , on the web I am kenju254 but my friends call me Kenju.
You can just call me Kenju....


I know C/C++ , Java , VB.NET and I code in Python daily. I do web applications mostly, I tend to use
Django and a bit of webapp2(GAE). I am curious to learn Flask ,Pyramid and Turbogears. 

I am looking forward to being a vim master in the next 6 months, I use Ubuntu(13.10) for my development 
environment and I am a supporter FOSS. You can find me on this:

1. [Github](http://github.com/kenju254)
2. [Bitbucket](http://bitbucket.com/kenju254)
3. [Twitter](http://twitter.com/kenju254)

When I am  programming, I love listening to music on [Soundcloud](http://soundcloud.com/kenju254) and some 
AfroHouse, HouseMusic will do the trick. 

When I am not programming, I spend time on [Quora](http://quora.com/kenju254) and on my Flipboard stream 
from my phone. I love Music and I am all rounder so I listen to almost anything but preference to HipHop,
and my new love AfroPop, AfroHouse, Qwaito. I play basketball, and also watch the NBA. Miami Heat is my 
team.

I am not the avid reader but I started picking along, after a being inspired to read 
[The Outliers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outliers_(book)) by [Nickson Kaigi](http://twitter.com/nickaigi
) and now am on my 3rd book. Follow my book collection on [Goodreads](http://goodreads.com/kenju254) Reading 
is good and I am liking it so far, learning a lot of new stuff.
